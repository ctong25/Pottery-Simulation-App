# Pottery Simulation Application

### An application to create a successful piece of pottery from beginning to end. Beware the obstacles preventing you from succeeding however. 

This application will allow a user to create a *new animal profile* by filling in its information and 
be able to use these animal profiles to create a list of endangered animals they are interested 
in following & learning more about.

Each animal profile includes:
- The animal's name
- How many are left in the wild
- Their conservation status
- Places in the world that they inhabit

The people who will use it include: 
- Animal conservationists & environmentalists (ecologists)
- Students
- The general public interested in animal conservation

This project interests me because I've always loved animals growing up. However, 
the concept of **endangered animals** hadn't occurred to me until technology became more prevalent in my life, 
which was around high school. Because of this, I want to help increase awareness about **endangered animals** 
to the bigger community through technology in an organization application for users to keep track of the 
**endangered animals** they know about. Being able to pursue a future career related to 
animal conservation and technology would be an incredible opportunity for me to do something
I'm passionate about so *I hope this project allows me to learn and gain more experience about this topic.*
